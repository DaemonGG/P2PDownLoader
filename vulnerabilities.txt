The current vulnerabilities are:
1) SOmetime the upload timeout just happens before the first data is sent.
2) Can not prevent man in middle attack. means can not distinguish fake ACK and DATA packets
3) if the network environment is very very bab. there might be a situation where the first few data packets of the old connection 
   just come and the Seq number is inside the new connecion's window room. then this downloaded chunk might be incorrect.
4) Quite a lot of sender peers write the problem_peer-2 file at the same time, might cause some problem
